# Preconditioned Model Building Solver (PMBSolve)

PMBSolve is an optimization solver for solving unconstrained problems of the form
```
min f(x),
```
where f is a differentiable real-value function defined on n-dimensional Euclidean space. Below, we have implementations for various programming languages.

## PMBSolve for Octave/MATLAB

This implementation has been tested on Octave 4.2.1 and MATLAB 2105b. In addition to basic usage on several test functions, we also present a **matrix factorization** example on a movie recommendation data set.

## PMBSolve for Julia

This implementation has been tested on Julia 0.4.6. We demonstrate ```pmbsolve``` method on several test functions.

## PMBSolve for Python

Coming soon.

## PMBSolve for C

Coming soon.
